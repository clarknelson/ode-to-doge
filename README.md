# Ode To Doge

In the summer of 2014, I attended a UX / UI design bootcamp in Chicago called Designation. One of the exercises was to create a simple html/css webpage, so I decided to create this page for a meme I enjoy.


I am considering upgrading to fetch the memes from another service such as know your meme.
